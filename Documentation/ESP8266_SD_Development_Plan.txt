ESP8266_SD Development Plan
===========================

I intend to develop an ESP8266 based seizure detector in a staged way,
testing the feasibility of continuing at each stage.

The basic idea is that we will have an ESP8266 system-on-chip module
connected to an ADXL345 accelerometer using an i2c interface.
The data collection, analysis and seizure detection will take place on
the ESP8266 in the same way as the Pebble OpenSeizureDetector works.
The ESP8266 will act as a NetworkDatasource for the OpenSeizureDetector
Android device based alarm system.

The hardware will be mounted in a wrist mounted, 3d printed case that
also contains a rechargable battery.

The development stages are:
1.  Feasibility Study - can we program an ESP8266, can we make it talk
    to the ADXL345 and can it run the OpenSeizureDetector detection
    algorithm.   If we can not do this, the project is a non-starter.

2.  Proof-of-Concept - Develop the system into a functioning seizure
    detector that connects to the OpenSeizureDetector Android based alarm
    system, and investigate power consumption.   Can we get the power
    consumption down to a level where it will run for over 12 hours on
    a single battery charge?   Again, if not, there is no point in
    developing further.

3.  Prototype - hand assembled minature hardware - use an ESP8266 E12
    module with a discrete ADXL345 to make it small enough to fit in
    a watch case.  Produce 3d printed watch case
